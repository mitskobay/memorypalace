## How to Use the Shape Builder Tool in Adobe Illustrator

Breaking down the @ForeverDansky youtube short of the same title

1. Create a new file in Illustrator
2. Draw a circle (ellipse tool, `shift` while dragging)
3. Adjust dimensions and increase stroke thickness (I used 100px width and height, 20px stroke)
4. Align Stroke to Center (Properties > Appearance > Stroke > Align Stroke)
4. Duplicate circle (use selection tool [v], `option` while dragging)
5. Activate Snap to Point (View > Snap to Point)
6. Use direct selection tool [a] to align circles horizontally
7. Select both circles and duplicate them (make sure tool shows dotty square before option-dragging)
8. Use direct selection tool to align circles vertically
9. Select all four circles
10. Select Shape Builder Tool (in toolbar on left, it looks like two circles and direct selection tool, or use shift+M)
11. Draw a path connecting upper right and lower left circles, through the space between them
12. Remove the other two circles by holding down `option` while dragging through them, or hovering over the path
13. The video calls the resulting figure a "metaball."
14. Removing the path creates the problem of a rogue path which must be removed
15. Switching to outline mode (view > outline) will show the rogue path
16. Use the direct selection tool to select, move, and delete the path
17. We will now make a tiling of metaballs
18. Swap fill and stroke (click double arrow)
19. Create new anchor points between original anchor points (Object > Path > Add Anchor Points)
20. Duplicate shape on a new layer (layer menu > duplicate layer)
21. Rotate ([r]) new shape 90 degrees by holding `shift`
22. Use direct selection tool [a] to create tile
23. Use Object > Repeat > Grid to repeat tile
24. Use Object > Repeat > Options... to adjust spacing (I used -120px for both horizontal and vertical spacing)
