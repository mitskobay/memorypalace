## How to convert XLS to semicolon-separated CSV

The problem: MS Excel does not have an easy way to convert an XLS file to a semicolon-separated CSV.

What follows is the easiest way I know so far to get this done.

# Manually
- Use MS Excel to save the XLS file to a tab-separated txt file.
- Use a text editor to replace tabs with semicolons and save as csv.

# AutoMACically
- I will look into Shortcuts.
- There is a Applescripts way here: ([1])
