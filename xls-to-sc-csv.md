## How to convert XLS to semicolon-separated CSV

The problem: MS Excel does not have an easy way to convert an XLS file to a semicolon-separated CSV.

What follows is the easiest way I know so far to get this done.

# XLS to semicolon-separated CSV
- Use MS Excel to save the XLS file to a tab-separated txt file.
- Use a text editor to replace tabs with semicolons and save as csv.
